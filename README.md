# VMO<sup>3

## Business/Technical Challenge
Have you ever set up your out of office message in Outlook, but forgot to change voice mail? 
Or maybe you've returned to the office and forgot to disable that voice mail telling everyone that you are on vacation.

VMO<sup>3</sup> allows users to enable their out of office message once and have it reflected across multiple platforms. 

## Proposed Solution

Our application will integrate O365 Exchange Out of Office alerting with Cisco Unity Connect (UCXN) and 
Cisco Unified Communication Manager (CUCM). Users can set their OoO alert in email and have it automatically enabled in 
voice mail. They will also receive a daily listing of inbound calls, so they can see who called while they were 
out of the office, even if the person did not leave a voice mail.
